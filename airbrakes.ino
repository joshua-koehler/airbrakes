//*TODO*
/*	1. Add real mass of rocket in the define statement
		2. Check units of all sensors
		3. Modularize functions

Also a few optimization decisions to make:
1.	Should each get____ function get a new event, or should they all be passed
		the same event for consistency?

2.	Is using the system time accurate enought to compute velocity with the
		altimeter?

3.	If #2 is good, should we use the same method to compute accleration instead
		of the accelerometer?

4.	Consider the system timing of the PID, and how using our own timing in the 
		velocity function could affect this.

5.  Add code to turn off the airbrakes after a successful flight

6. Make sure the max for the analogWrite, hardware limit switches, and PID limit		are all in sync.  Default PID limit should be 255 (2^8 -1)
